## CINECA synthetic cohort Europe CH SIB

The “CINECA synthetic cohort EUROPE CH SIB” dataset consists of 6733 synthetic samples with phenotypic and genotypic information. The synthetic phenotypic data were created from the CoLaus and PsyColaus cohort and the synthetic genetic data from the 1000 Genomes project. CoLaus and PsyColaus cohorts include data from more than 6k Causasian individuals aged 35 to 75 years living in Lausanne, Switzerland. CoLaus focuses on cardiovascular disorders and PsyCoLaus focuses on psychiatric disorders. CoLaus/PsyCoLaus cohort collects demographic, socio-economical, life-style, and clinical information from enrolled patients. While CoLaus/PsyCoLaus contains phenotypic data, the 1000 Genomes data was used to minimise the used data and improve patient’s privacy.
